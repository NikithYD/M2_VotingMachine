# Introduction
The project is about Electronic voting machine which is implemented using Microcontroller Atmega 328p. The prototype designed is helpful for various occasions like school, college, office corporate votings in a simple and efficient manner.
# Timeline and Implementation
The Gannt chart below represents the design and implementaion of the project simulation
![April 4 -11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68335075/163686770-8dfddfc8-4c15-490a-a51d-5e0042382d44.png)
# Features
 * Atmega 328p controller for fast and efficient implementation
 * HD44780 16x2 Liquid crystal display for user interface output device
 * Four pushbuttons for user interface input device
 * Button specific to the organiser(one who conducts)
 * RGB Led to indicate the status of operation
# SWOT Analysis
Below chart shows the SWOT analysis of the project designed-
![Practical implementation is simple and efficient Features are easy to use Simulation helps in reducing problems due to hardware](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68335075/163702406-bce5a8f4-e22d-4542-966e-651eb90fe52a.png) 
# 4Ws and 1Hs
 * Who- Students and teachers especially in schools and colleges and for small scale voting requirements are benifitted
 * What- The aim of the project is to simulate and implement Electronic voting machine using Atmega328p, 16x2 LCD,pushbuttons and RGB LED
 * When- It will be helpful when lowcost, simple and economical voting is needed
 * Where- Useful in organizations, schools, colleges, offices for voting purpose
 * How - Implemented in voting spots inside room where user has to be present within the range of PIR sensor and can choose the necessary candidate with ease
